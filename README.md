# mh-inventory
This is the ps-inventory but i edit it for mh-cashasitem and mh-stashes,
also i renamed it back to qb-inventory cause the most servers uses that name in the exports,
and if that is the case you can rename every export,
but now in this version this is not needed anymore, i keep it as default as possible, 
if you already had ps-inventory you need to rename all your exports back to how it was.
